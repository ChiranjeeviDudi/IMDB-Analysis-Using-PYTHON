# IMDB_Analysis Using PYTHON (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In this Project i have used IMDB Movies Dataset which i've got from the Kaggle platform
               
I have used PYTHON Language in building this project which includes some of the python liabraries such as :
1. PANDAS
2. SEABORN
3. MATPLOTLIB

In This Project i have imported the IMDB Movie Dataset using pandas liabrary. after importing the dataset i have deal with some of the cleaning process like checking and removing the null values. After that cleaning part i have done some of the basic operations from the table and i have done some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using seaborn and matplotlib liabraries and i have deal with certain Vizualizations Barplot, Countplot and Scatterplot.

Exploratory Data Analysis includes the steps : 
1. Data Cleaning
2. Statistics of the Dataset
3. Average Ratings for the Directors
4. Highest Average Revenue
5. Top Movie Titles generated highest revenue
6. Finding that Does Rating Effects the Revenue or Not using the Scatterplot

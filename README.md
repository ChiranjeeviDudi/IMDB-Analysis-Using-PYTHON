# IMDB_Analysis Using PYTHON (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In this Project i have used IMDB Movies Dataset which i've got from the Kaggle platform                                                                               

OBJECTIVE : The main Objective of this project is to perform some statistical and Predictive analysis of IMDB movie dataset to draw some visualized insights analysis about the movies to provide a detailed overview of the movies. In this project using scatter plot i have used predictions on the change in the value of review that effects the Revenue.
               
I have used PYTHON Language in building this project which includes some of the python libraries such as :
1. PANDAS
2. SEABORN
3. MATPLOTLIB

In This Project i have imported the IMDB Movie Dataset using pandas library. after importing the dataset i have deal with some of the cleaning process like checking and removing the null values. After that cleaning part i have done some of the basic operations from the table and i have done some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using seaborn and matplotlib libraries and i have deal with certain Vizualizations like Barplot, Countplot and Scatterplot.

Exploratory Data Analysis includes the steps : 
1. Data Cleaning
2. Statistics of the Dataset
3. Average Ratings for the Directors
4. Highest Average Revenue
5. Top Movie Titles generated highest revenue
6. Finding that Does Rating Effects the Revenue or Not using the Scatterplot
